        <p>My name is Yangyifan Wang (Kim) and I'm a second year graduate student majoring in computer science.
            I got my bachelor degree in Economics from UCLA three years ago, and I then worked in an investment bank for
            two years before I decided to switch my career path. I really like computer science and want to be an excellent
            software engineer. I also enjoy movies and shopping.
